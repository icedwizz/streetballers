-mobile football arena hire 
-Panna cage (skills cage) 
Street soccer has been very popular in Europe for the last ten or more years and is just starting to really catch on here as more people are realising the benefits of small sided or 1v1 games 
The mobile soccer arena and Panna cage both promote technical ability with enclosed playing space and rebound boards meaning the ball is constantly in play  so players have a lot more touches of the ball compared to larger  sided games . 
Both can be set up indoors and outdoors on most surfaces and the arena size can be adjusted to fit most halls , community centres etc making it ideal for birthday parties as well as all sporting events . 

We can also set up a fan/ pro zone for any tournament/event including 
-Mobile soccer arena 
-Panna cage 
-ball launcher 
-inflatable target shot 
-speed shot 
-soccer bouncy castle
